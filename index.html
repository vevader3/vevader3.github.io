                <p> In the University of South Carolina, there is no one good way to figure out where to get
                    to your classes as an incoming student. While a map of the buildings is provided, students are
                    left clueless as to where in the massive buildings their classrooms are. Our app aims to provide
                    an interactive and simple way to help students better locate their classes and navigate through
                    campus.</p>

                <p> My Group and I worked together to brainstorm any possible limitations of our idea, and to 
                    create solutions to these potential problems. As a result, I believe that our app now will work 
                    better for its users.
