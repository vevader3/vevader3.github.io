                    <p> In the University of South Carolina, there is no one good way to figure out where to get
                        to your classes as an incoming student. While a map of the buildings is provided, students are
                        left clueless as to where in the massive buildings their classrooms are. Our app aims to provide
                        an interactive and simple way to help students better locate their classes and navigate through
                        campus.</p>

                    <p> My Group and I worked together to brainstorm any possible limitations of our idea, and to 
                        create solutions to these potential problems. As a result, I believe that our app now will work 
                        better for its users.

                <a href="Files/sketch.pdf"><img src="Images/sketchpart1.png"> </a>
                    <p> This is a sketch that I made as a demonstration of what our app could actually look like 
                        to its users. Users would input what building and classroom they want to go to, and the 
                        app will give them directions both to the building and the room itself.

                <a href="https://youtu.be/yuMqVNuVjqk"><img src="Images/paper-prototype.png"> </a>
                    
                    <p> After we all created our sketches, we deliberated on what the best design was. We
                        ultimately decided on this one, and turned it into our paper prototype. This video 
                        demonstrates a general idea of how the app will work, from finding directions to
                        making schedules.
